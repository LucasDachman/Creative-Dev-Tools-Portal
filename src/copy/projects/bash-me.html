   <h1>Hello,</h1>
   <p>I'm Lucas and I'm a TAM major and CS minor. I love anything that
       has to do with computers or music â€“ <i>especially together.</i>
       Besides taking the WEB class, I interned as a software engineer
       developing a data analytics and visualization web application
       for Polycom. From that experience, I learned about Javascript, 
       React.js, REST APIs, and Agile Scrum. I'm interested in learning
       about DevOps, Music Tech, D3.js and advanced CSS design.
